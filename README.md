### Short pitch

**Pain:**

A company or a DAO that wants to issue a coupon or a voucher is faced with the following challenges:
- How to assure the coupon/voucher cannot be forged?
- How to manage coupon/voucher issuance and offer claims by users?
- How to manage disputes?

**Solution:**

The solution is to have coupons and vouchers as NFTs. This prevents forgery because the NFT issuer can always be verified by any user (as can be coupons themselves). Coupons and vouchers as NFTs can also be easily transferred from one user to another. Companies, DAOs, and individuals that want to issue coupons/vouchers via the Kupon protocol do not need to develop their own management system to handle management and disputes.

**Target audience:**

Traditionally, coupons and vouchers are most often used by companies for their products or services. With the advent of DAOs, we believe the need for coupons and vouchers will arise in the crypto world too. An example of such a DAO would be a tutoring DAO that offers education services and can sell lessons through vouchers or attract customers with discount coupons.
